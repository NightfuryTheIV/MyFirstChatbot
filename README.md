# My First Chatbot

Link : https://github.com/NightfuryTheIV/MyFirstChatbot

This repository contains a Python program for analyzing presidential speeches and generating adapted reponses to user-given questions.
The short-term goal of this project is to discover Git, while the long-term goal is to learn how to code efficiently.
This project can be broken down into two parts: one that comprises the basic function required to smoothly run the second part, and the second part that carries out the duties it was given.
Keep in mind that this code may take a minute to run.
David had issues with his Git and couldn't commit for an extended period of time I believe so he sent me most of his code which I then inserted into the main code.
We have used some branches to test out singular bits of code that we deleted after testing it, so they may or may not show in the history of this depository.

## How to use specific functions
You **HAVE** to use the features with a TF-IDF matrix as argument.
When it comes to question processing, you have to use `response(question_vector(question_words(tokenize(question))))`, or you can just use the `conveniency(question)` function to achieve the same result more conveniently.
The `response` function doesn't generate anything.

Looking forward to have feedback from you,
# Da√Øf Moindjie and David Dehondt.
